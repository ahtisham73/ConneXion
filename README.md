# üñß **ConneXion: Network Simulation Design for Organizational Connectivity**

![Network Design](https://github.com/ahtisham73/ConneXion/blob/f4d7cd73d996b88eb2bede4db4e9f467003b592f/Network-Design.jpg)


**ConneXion** is a comprehensive network design project built using Cisco Packet Tracer, showcasing a robust infrastructure for an organization with multiple branches and server management. This design ensures efficient communication, optimized resource allocation, and seamless connectivity across the company's internal network.

## üìÇ **Repository Contents**
- **`ConneXion_Topology.pkt`**: Cisco Packet Tracer file containing the complete network topology, including branch and server configurations.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation, including network design details and setup instructions.
- **`LICENSE`**: License file for the project.

## üìú **Project Overview**
This project models the network design of an organization with two branches located in different states and a central server. It incorporates key networking concepts such as **VLAN**, **IP Address Allocation**, **DHCP**, **HTTP**, **DNS**, and **Routing Protocols** to build a scalable, efficient, and secure network infrastructure.

### Key Features:
- **Dynamic and Static IP Allocation**: Different departments with dynamically assigned IP addresses through DHCP and static IP addresses using VLANs.
- **VLAN and Inter-VLAN Routing**: Segmenting the network traffic and enabling communication between different VLANs.
- **WLAN**: Wireless connectivity provided for specific departments.
- **Routing Information Protocol (RIP)**: Enabling communication between the branches using the RIP routing protocol.

## üßë‚Äçüíª **Key Network Components**
1. **Branches**:
   - **Two Branches**: Each branch is designed with a network infrastructure that includes five departments.
2. **Servers**:
   - **DHCP and HTTP Server**: One server for DHCP and HTTP services, ensuring dynamic IP assignment and web services.
   - **DNS Server**: A dedicated server for DNS services, resolving domain names.
3. **Routers and RIP Protocol**: Routers communicate with each other across branches using the RIP protocol to route network traffic efficiently.
4. **IP Address Allocation**:
   - **Yellow**: Dynamic IP addresses assigned via DHCP.
   - **Sky Blue**: Dynamic IP addresses assigned via WLAN.
   - **Purple**: Static IP addresses using VLANs and inter-VLAN routing.

## üîß **Key Network Concepts**
- **Static and Dynamic IP Allocation**: Understanding IP address management for devices within the network.
- **VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network)**: Network segmentation for better traffic management.
- **Inter-VLAN Routing**: Facilitates communication between different VLANs for seamless data flow.
- **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**: Automatic IP address assignment for network devices.
- **HTTP and DNS Services**: Web services (HTTP) and domain name resolution (DNS).
- **RIP (Routing Information Protocol)**: Distance-vector routing protocol for efficient data routing.

## üåê **How to Use the Network Design**
1. **Open Cisco Packet Tracer**.
2. **Load the Project File**: Open the `ConneXion_Topology.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
3. **Explore the Network Components**:
   - View the configuration of routers, switches, servers, and connected devices.
   - Inspect the settings for **DHCP**, **HTTP**, and **DNS** services.
   - Analyze the **VLAN** configurations and **Inter-VLAN Routing** setup.
4. **Test Connectivity**: Use `ping` commands and other networking tools to verify the connectivity between devices across branches.

## üìä **Network Visualization**
The design file includes a visual representation of the following components:
- **Core Network**: Central routers and switches connecting all devices and branches.
- **Branch Networks**: Color-coded network configurations for dynamic and static IP allocation.
- **Servers**: DHCP, HTTP, and DNS services.
- **Interconnection**: Routers communicating across the branches using RIP.

## üìà **Benefits of ConneXion Design**
- **Scalability**: Easily adaptable to future branch expansions.
- **Security**: Use of VLANs ensures segmentation of traffic, adding a layer of security.
- **Efficiency**: Inter-VLAN routing and RIP ensure fast and efficient communication between devices across different locations.

## üìù **Conclusion**
**ConneXion** provides a reliable and scalable network design that caters to the needs of a growing organization. The project integrates best practices in IP address management, network segmentation, and routing protocols, ensuring seamless connectivity and optimal performance across the network.

## üìö **Future Work**
- **Network Expansion**: Add more branches and devices to the network as the company grows.
- **Advanced Security**: Implement additional security protocols such as ACLs and firewalls for enhanced protection.
- **Automation**: Explore the use of network automation tools for configuration management and monitoring.
